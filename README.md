# Links/Resources/Notes/etc

This is a respository of links, useful materials, resources, notes etc that I collect from various materials (inc. promotional materials, magazines, research, articles, etc.). I am taking these notes for my research, but seeing as these links and resources can be ephemeral and dependent on being in the 'right place at the right time', I figured they could be useful to someone.

My research is in open source digital/new media art practice, so an awful lot of the resources I upload will concern these topics.

I'll be uploading these resources as markdown files

I'm currently trying to figure out the best way to 'tag' individual items so that they are easily greppable

If you also went to any events that I have uploaded a resource list from and have more to add, please fork and add any resources i've missed
